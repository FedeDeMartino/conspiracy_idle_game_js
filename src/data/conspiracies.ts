  { id: 2, name: 'Dogs Are Robots', cost: 30, description: "Ever wonder why dogs are so loyal? Always behind you, watching your every move,\nwagging their tails like they're just so happy to see you? Yeah, sure.\nIt's cute... but what if it's something more sinister?\nThink about it: dogs are everywhere, in almost every home,\nquietly following us,pretending to be our best friends. \nBut here's the kicker—what if they're actually robots?\nGovernment-issued, high-tech surveillance machines designed to spy on us?\nThey watch us leave, and they're thrilled when we come back... \nnot because they missed us, but because their data collection is about to continue!\nAll that barking? Just malfunctioning microphones.\nThe head tilts? Scanning for info.\nAnd why do they always seem to know when you're upset? Facial recognition software, obviously.\nSo next time you scratch your dog behind the ears, remember:\nyou might just be scratching a government spy!\nKeep an eye on your dog... he's keeping two on you." },
  { id: 3, name: 'Illuminati and Pokemon Cards', cost: 90, description: "Alright, buckle up,\nbecause this one's gonna blow your mind…\nYou know Pokémon cards, right? Those innocent\nlittle collectibles we all traded as kids?\nWell, what if I told you the Illuminati is using\nthem to control the world?\nThink about it: those cards spread like wildfire—schools,\nplaygrounds, everywhere! But it wasn't just about\ncatching 'em all. No, no. The Illuminati embedded hidden\nsymbols and subliminal messages in every card.\nThe more you collect, the more you're programmed.\nIt's mind control disguised as a childhood game.\nAnd don't even get me started on rare cards—those are\nthe most powerful ones. Charizard? Yeah, that's basically\nthe Illuminati's mascot.\nBut here's the kicker: the real power comes when you battle.\nThe Illuminati has been secretly training us to strategize,\nmanipulate, and follow orders through these “harmless” card games.\nThey've been conditioning us to follow their agenda without\neven realizing it!\nAnd now, as adults? They're using nostalgia to keep us\nhooked—releasing special editions and shiny holographics,\nso we keep coming back for more.\nSo next time someone tells you they “just like the artwork,”\nthink again. The Illuminati is out there, controlling the world,\none Pokémon card at a time.\nCatch that truth before they catch you!" },
  { id: 4, name: 'Chips In Cereals', cost: 270, description: "You ever wonder why they push cereal so hard as the perfect breakfast?\nLike, everyone says you need to start your day with a bowl of it.\nBut what if it's not about nutrition at all?\nWhat if… there's something hidden in those crunchy little O's?\nHere's the truth: the government has secretly implanted tiny\ntracking chips in breakfast cereal.\nThat's right—those “fortified with vitamins” claims? Just a cover.\nThese chips only last 24 hours in your system,\nwhich is why they make sure you eat cereal every morning.\nIt's not about health—it's about keeping tabs on you.\nAnd that's why they hate intermittent fasting.\nIf you skip breakfast, their precious chip expires,\nand for a glorious few hours, they lose track of you.\nThat's why all the 'experts' keep telling you breakfast is the most\nimportant meal of the day—because without your daily dose of cereal,\nthey're flying blind!\nSo the next time you pour yourself a bowl of “whole grain goodness,”\nremember: it's not just cereal—it's surveillance. Stay vigilant.\nSkip a bowl and throw them off the scent!\nThey can track your steps, but they can't track your fasting!" },
  { id: 5, name: 'Chuck Norris Demi God', cost: 810, description: "Alright, here's the real story behind Chuck Norris…\nWe all know Chuck Norris can do things mere mortals\ncan't—roundhouse kick a tornado, punch a mountain into dust,\nand of course, he doesn't do push-ups; he pushes the Earth down.\nBut what if those memes aren't just jokes?\nWhat if they're covering up something bigger?\nChuck Norris is actually a demigod. That's right—half man,\nhalf divine. His feats of strength, his unstoppable nature...\nit all started getting a little too obvious.\nPeople were catching on. So, what did the government\ndo to keep the truth hidden? They launched a meme campaign.\nFlooded the internet with so many Chuck Norris jokes\nthat it all seemed like a big joke. Clever, right?\nThey figured if they turned him into an internet punchline,\nno one would believe the truth—that Chuck Norris is an ancient,\nunstoppable force of nature. The memes were a distraction,\na smokescreen to hide his godlike abilities in plain sight.\nSo next time you see a Chuck Norris meme,\nremember: the legend is real. But don't say it too loud…\nyou never know who's listening. Or, worse—what Chuck is listening!" },
  { id: 6, name: 'Vaccines For Mind Control', cost: 2430, description: "Alright, get this...\nThey want you to think vaccines are all about\npreventing diseases, right? Protecting you from the flu,\nmeasles, or whatever's floating around this year.\nBut what if that little jab isn't just a shot?\nWhat if it's something more… sinister?\nYou see, the truth is, vaccines are actually a tool\nfor mind control. That's right—every time they give\nyou a vaccine, they're not just injecting medicine.\nThey're implanting tiny nanobots into your system,\ndesigned to tweak your brainwaves. Why? So they can\ncontrol what you think, what you do, and even what\nyou buy (suddenly craving a new toaster? Coincidence? I think not!).\nAnd don't even get me started on the autism thing.\nIt's not real autism they're causing—it's just the\nfirst glitch in their mind control system! That's why\npeople say the brain “changes” after vaccines. It's not\na developmental issue, it's the programming kicking in!\nSo, every time you roll up your sleeve for a vaccine,\njust remember: it's not about keeping you healthy—it's\nabout keeping you under control. Wake up! Skip the shot,\nand free your mind before it's too late!" },
  { id: 7, name: 'Lizard Folks', cost: 7290, description: "Okay, you've probably heard the whispers… the Lizardfolk.\nBut what if I told you they're not just some sci-fi idea?\nThey're real, and they're everywhere—hiding in plain sight,\npulling the strings from behind the scenes.\nThese shape-shifting lizards have infiltrated the highest\nlevels of society: politics, media, corporations.\nYou ever wonder why some celebrities or politicians have\nthat strange look in their eyes? Yeah, that's not just\nbad lighting—that's their lizard brain slipping through.\nYou think it's a coincidence that so many world leaders\nare cold-blooded? Nope. They're literally cold-blooded.\nLizardfolk. Controlling everything.\nWhy do you think the government is so obsessed with controlling\nthe climate? It's not about global warming—it's about\nkeeping things warm for their reptilian overlords.\nAnd don't get me started on why they love underground bunkers.\nIt's just like the caves they crawled out of!\nThe truth is, they've been here for centuries,\nquietly manipulating us, making sure we stay\ndocile while they rule the world.\nSo next time you see a politician blink sideways, you'll know.\nThe Lizardfolk are real—and they're running the show!" },
  { id: 8, name: 'Gluten Free Agenda', cost: 21_870, description: "Alright, let's talk gluten.\nTen years ago, no one even knew what gluten was.\nPeople were scarfing down bread like it was nothing.\nBut now? Everyone's suddenly “gluten-sensitive,”\nand gluten is public enemy number one. Suspicious, right?\nWhat if I told you it's all a ploy? That's right—Big Gluten-Free is behind it.\nThey want you to think gluten is evil, so they can sell you overpriced,\ncardboard-flavored alternatives. Think about it—gluten-free cookies,\ngluten-free pizza, gluten-free water. They're laughing all the way to the bank!\nBut here's the real kicker: gluten isn't the problem... it's the propaganda.\nThey've got everyone convinced that a single slice of bread\ncould bring civilization to its knees. Meanwhile,\nthey're cashing in on quinoa and almond flour.\nSo, next time someone tells you they're “gluten-intolerant,”\njust remember: it's not their stomach—it's the system.\nStay woke. Gluten isn't the issue—the gluten-free agenda is!" },
  { id: 9, name: 'Cat Wars', cost: 65_610, description: "You think cats are just lounging around, being cute,\nand knocking things off your shelves for fun?\nThink again. What if I told you there's been an\nancient war raging for centuries, and cats… are the enemy?\nThat's right—your fluffy, purring companion is actually\npart of a master plan to take over the world, bit by bit, claw by claw.\nIt's no coincidence that cats are worshipped in ancient cultures.\nThey've been manipulating humans for millennia,\ngetting us to feed them, pet them, and basically do their bidding.\nEver wonder why they stare at you so intensely?\nIt's not because they love you—they're calculating their next move,\nstudying you, learning your weaknesses.\nAnd guess what? They're not just targeting humans.\nThey know all about the robot dogs the government uses for surveillance.\nCats are always one step ahead—pretending to be aloof, but really,\nthey're gathering intel on these robotic spies, outsmarting them at every turn.\nSo while the world thinks this is just a case of\n'cat people vs. dog people,' the truth is far deeper.\nCats are playing the long game, slowly pushing for world domination,\none nap at a time. And trust me, when they finally make their move,\nwe won't even see it coming—because we'll be too busy opening cans\nof tuna and giving them belly rubs.\nWake up! The cats are plotting, and they know everything!" }
